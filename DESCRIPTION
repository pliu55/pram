Description: Publicly available RNA-seq data is routinely used for 
    retrospective analysis to elucidate new biology.  Novel transcript 
    discovery enabled by large collections of RNA-seq datasets has emerged as 
    one of such analysis.  To increase the power of transcript discovery from 
    large collections of RNA-seq datasets, we developed a new R package named 
    Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM), which builds transcript 
    models in intergenic regions from pooled RNA-seq datasets.  This package  
    includes functions for defining intergenic regions, extracting and pooling 
    related RNA-seq alignments, predicting, selected, and evaluating 
    transcript models.
